🧵 Final_susfashion: Sustainable Fashion Analytics with Power BI
📄 Summary
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive analysis of global fashion brands by clustering them based on environmental friendliness and sustainable material usage. It evaluates over 3,996 brands across 10 countries, examining critical sustainability metrics such as carbon footprint, water usage, waste generation, and adoption of certified sustainable materials. The dashboard offers actionable insights into which brands and materials are leading or lagging in sustainability efforts.

🎯 Objectives
Cluster Fashion Brands by environmental impact (Eco-Friendly, Moderate Pollution, Highly Polluted).

Evaluate Certifications such as GOTS, OEKO-TEX, B Corp, and Fair Trade.

Analyze Sustainable Materials including Bamboo, Organic Cotton, Hemp, Tencel, etc.

Track Market Trends in material usage and sustainability ratings across time (2010–2024).

Compare Environmental Metrics such as waste (kg) and water usage (liters) across brands and materials.

Provide Geographic Insights on the global distribution of eco-friendly and polluting brands.

🧠 Assumptions
The dataset represents self-reported or externally validated environmental metrics from fashion brands.

Clustering is based on normalized values of carbon footprint, waste, and water usage.

Certifications are treated as equally weighted indicators of sustainability.

Material ratings reflect cumulative brand usage and sustainable properties over the years.

Time series data assumes consistent yearly reporting (some noise possible in missing values).

🔮 Prediction & Trends
Eco-Friendly brands tend to have the highest water usage but lower carbon footprint per output.

Recycled Polyester and Hemp dominate in sustainable ratings and brand adoption.

Brands using Organic Cotton and Bamboo Fabric show moderate sustainability with increasing adoption post-2015.

The trend from 2010 to 2024 suggests a growing market interest in Vegan Leather, although its sustainability rating remains moderate.

Certifications like GOTS and OEKO-TEX are most prevalent among brands classified as eco-conscious.

✅ Actionable Recommendations
Prioritize support for Eco-Friendly clusters with high water usage but low carbon impact — consider water conservation tech investment.

Encourage wider adoption of certifications like B Corp and OEKO-TEX in Moderate and Highly Polluting clusters.

Invest in material innovation — especially for Bamboo and Tencel — as their cost-efficiency and rating improve.

Target policy and incentives at countries showing lower adoption of sustainable practices (use map insights).

Promote public transparency dashboards for fashion sustainability using this Power BI model as a foundation.
